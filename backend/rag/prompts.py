# Transcript
Speaker: Welcome, everyone. Today, we're going to explore the history of the Aztec Empire, from its humble beginnings to its dramatic fall.

The Aztecs, also known as the Mexica, began their journey in the 13th century, searching for a new home as instructed by their god, Huitzilopochtli. This quest ended when they founded Tenochtitlán, on a small island in Lake Texcoco, around 1325. This city, now beneath modern-day Mexico City, was a testament to their ingenuity and strength, growing to become one of the largest cities in the world at its peak.

The Aztec society was intricately structured, with the Emperor at the pinnacle, viewed as a god among men. Society was divided into several classes, from nobles and priests to warriors, merchants, and farmers. The Aztecs were known for their architectural prowess, evident in the grand Templo Mayor, a symbol of their religious and political power. They were also skilled astronomers and calendar makers, contributing significantly to our understanding of the universe.

However, it wasn't just their scientific achievements that defined them. The Aztecs had a rich cultural tradition, with art, music, and poetry that revealed their deep spiritual and worldly views.

Unfortunately, the empire's strength and prosperity eventually led to its downfall. In 1519, Hernán Cortés and his Spanish conquistadors landed on the Gulf of Mexico. Despite initial peaceful interactions, conflict soon ensued. The combination of Spanish military tactics, alliances with local tribes opposed to the Aztecs, and the introduction of European diseases led to the fall of Tenochtitlán in 1521.

The conquest of the Aztec Empire marked the end of one of the most remarkable civilizations in history, but its legacy continues. The stories, ruins, and cultural practices of the Aztecs still play a vital role in Mexican culture and history today.

Thank you for joining me on this brief journey through the history of the Aztec Empire.
